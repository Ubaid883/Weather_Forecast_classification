# Weather_Forecast_classification

This project is a weather forecast classification tool that leverages machine learning algorithms to classify weather conditions based on historical and meteorological data. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for setup, and information on how to use the model to make predictions.
# Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to classify weather conditions accurately using a machine learning model. By using various weather attributes, the model predicts specific weather classes such as "Temperature," "Pressure," "Humidity","Wind_Speed", "Cloud_Cover", etc. This project aims to support decision-making in various sectors, including agriculture, event planning, and logistics.
# Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for weather datasets.
- Several machine learning models for classification.
- Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, GreadSearchCV.
- Easy-to-use interface for making weather predictions.
# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (for visualizations)
- seaborn (for visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for exploration)
# Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure your dataset is in the correct format, containing features like temperature, humidity, Pressure, etc.
2. **Training the Model**: Run the model training script to train the classifier on your weather data.
3. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict weather classes on new data
# Model Training
The project includes a script for training models on the weather dataset. You can experiment with different classifiers such as decision trees, random forests, and ensemble methods to determine the best model for your data.
# Evaluation 
After training, the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix plots. These help to understand the classification results and improve the model if needed.
